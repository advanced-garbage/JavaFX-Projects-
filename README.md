# JavaFX-Projects-
JavaFX projects made at work.

The first project is a very simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe, designed with two players in mind. A very first primitive attempt, riddled with obtuse amounts of event handlers and checks, but it works.

The second project is a password generator. It accepts input for the length and whether it should have uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. After setting up the password options, the user clicks the "GENERATE" button and a password will appear below. It uses random logic so that each time the program will produce unique results.
